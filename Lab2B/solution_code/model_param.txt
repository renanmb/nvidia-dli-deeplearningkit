# Example Model Parameter Text

# All empty lines and lines beginning with # will be ignored (comments)
# Each line should contain:
#      layer-type, filter-count, kernel-size, batch-norm-bool, activation

# layer-type:
#      convv (convolution valid padding i.e. no-padding)
#      convf (convolution full padding i.e. padding of one less than kernel-size)
#      maxpool
# filter-count: number of filters you wish to train for a particular layer
# kernel-size: size of kernel for applying convolutions
# batch-norm-bool: boolean for whether you would like a batch-normalization to be performed after applying that layer
# activation: activation function to use
#      relu
#      lrelu (leaky-relu with 0.1 leak)

# Only three types layers and two types of activations are currently supported,
# one can easily add more in model.py parse_layers function though

# Example model definition:

convv, 32, 5, False, None
maxpool, 0, 2, True, lrelu
convv, 64, 3, True, lrelu
convv, 64, 3, False, None
maxpool, 0, 2, True, lrelu
convv, 128, 3, True, lrelu
